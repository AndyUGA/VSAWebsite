                “I always had a sense of guilt when I was younger. Going into college, it was always ingrained in me
                to
                put school first, reach for my accomplishments, have this career afterwards. I felt like I was
                always on
                this trajectory to reach a certain point, and when I did take a break, had fun or did something to
                enjoy
                myself, there was always this sense of guilt where I was telling myself, “should I really be doing
                this?
                Can I even afford to do this” and thinking back to my family about how much they sacrificed. “Am I
                allowed to have fun while my parents are working 10 hours a day to let me go to school?” Even then,
                it
                really magnified whenever I failed, didn’t reach a goal, or get a grade that I wanted. Everything
                would
                just hit me really hard where, not only was I feeling bad about not reaching my goal, but I felt bad
                about letting my family down. If I could go back and talk to that person, I would tell them that
                with
                all that time I used to build myself up as a person, to also build those relationships that are
                gonna
                last me a lifetime and really invest in those relationships that will come back to support me when
                I’m
                struggling or going through a rough time in life, and then also be able to put myself in a different
                environment and challenge myself in new ways and open myself up into different perspectives. I feel
                like
                that time was really invaluable to really take off that guilt and be willing to explore myself and
                my
                identity. Having that time to myself is what has carried on throughout any phase of life I’ve been
                on,
                any obstacle I’ve faced, moving from that point, once I’ve had that time to grow myself it's been a
                lot
                easier and I’ve picked up resources or little mental tools for how to handle any issues later on.
                Just
                don’t feel guilty, just have fun, stop being so hard on yourself all the time.”
